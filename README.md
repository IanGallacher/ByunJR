# ByunJR: StarCraft 2 Proxy Reaper Bot, based off of CommandCenter

Named after the player who is arguably the best in the world at proxy reaper, this bot aims to end the game before the other side has a chance to defend properly. This bot aims for perfect reaper micro - deal as much damage as possible without losing any reapers.

ByunJR uses the first commit of the [CommandCenter](https://github.com/davechurchill/commandcenter/) bot as a starting point - I highly recomend any and all starcraft2 bots use it as a starting point. CommandCenter is written by [David Churchill](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/), Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.mun.ca/) at Memorial University, and organizer of the [AIIDE StarCraft AI Competition](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/).

ByunJR has the following features implemented:
* All features of the first commit of CommandCenter - loading from config file, etc.

ByunJR has the following features currently planned:
* Use a genetic algorithm to determine the best reaper proxy locations.


Use this code for whatever purpose you want. I prefer if you let me know if you use my code and provide a link back to this repo.
